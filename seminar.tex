% Introduction
\section{Abstract}
Concolic execution \cite{godefroid2005dart} is a software verification technique that performs symbolic execution together with concrete input values. Concrete values are selected with the help of a constraint solver to guide a program flow in a particular direction. The selection of concrete values helps to scale the verification to a larger program as it makes the symbolic constraints smaller by selecting specific branches in the program. Compared to random execution, this allows us to guide the analysis in a direction likely to have bugs which makes this technique powerful. However, in doing so we sacrifice the completeness of the analysis in favor of the depth of analysis. The sheer number of branches in a large program makes it difficult to perform a complete analysis, so we have to prioritize the branches likely to contribute to finding a bug. There have been a lot of studies to deal with this path explosion problem. In this paper, I have presented state-of-the-art methods to deal with this problem.

\subsection{2007: Performing dynamic test generation compositionally}
\cite[paper]{godefroid2007compositional}

\subsubsection{Gist:}
The general idea behind this new search algorithm is to perform dynamic  test generation compositionally, by adapting (dualizing) known techniques for interproce-dural static analysis to the context of automated dynamic test gener-ation.

\subsubsection{Methodlogy:}
new search algorithm called SMART which stands for duce a new algorithm, dubbed SMARTfor Systematic Modular Automated Random Testing, a more efficent search method then DART without compromising
completeness. It tests functions in isolation, collects testing results as function summaries ex-pressed using preconditions on function inputs and postconditionson function outputs, and then re-use those summaries when testinghigher-level functions.

A SMART search performs dynamic test generation composi-tionally,  using  function  summaries  as  defined  previously.  Thosesummaries  are  dynamically  computed  in  a  top-down  mannerthrough the call-flow graphGPofP. Starting from the top-levelfunction, one executes the program (initially on some random in-puts) until one  reaches  a first functionfwhose execution termi-nates on a return orhaltstatement. One then backtracks insidefas much as  possible  using DART, computing summaries  for thatfunction and each of those DART-triggered executions. When thissearch (backtracking)  infis over, one then resumes the originalexecution wherefwas called,  this time treatingfessentially asa black-box,  i.e., without analyzing it and re-using its previouslycomputed  summary  instead. 

\subsubsection{Result:}
SMART can perform dynamic test generation com-positionally without any reduction in program path coverage. Wealso show that, given a bound on the maximum number of feasiblepaths in individual program functions, the number of program exe-cutions explored by SMART is linear in that bound, while the num-ber of program executions explored by DART can be exponentialin that bound.
SMART = scalable DART

\subsection{2006: Software Partitioning for Effective Automated Unit Testing}
\cite{chakrabarti2006software}

\subsubsection{Gist:}
present an approach thatidentifies control and data inter-dependencies between soft-ware components using static program analysis, and dividesthe source code into units where highly-intertwined compo-nents are grouped together. Those units can then be testedin isolation using automated test generation techniques andtools,  such as dynamic software model checkers

\subsubsection{Methodlogy:}
group together functions or components that share interfaces of complexity higher than 
a particular threshold. Complexity is determined by the popularity and sharing of code. The idea is that 
if the function is very popular and is being called from a lot of places then it is likely that it is not closely liked to any component. 
And, the sharing of code meaning if two functions share many of the same functions then it is likely that the higher level operation they perform is close to each other.

\subsubsection{Configurability part:}
evaluated the effectiveness by applying the algorithm to the open source implementation of oSIP protocol (http://www.gnu.org/software/osip/osip.html) which is a telephony protocol for call establishment. 


\subsubsection{Result:}
showing  that  auto-matic  software  partitioning  can  significantly  increase  testcoverage without generating too many false alarms causedby unrealistic inputs being injected at interfaces betweenunits

\section{Different catagorical bodies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item summerize, give an overview of the main points of each source and combine them into a coherent whole
	\item Analyze and interpret: don’t just paraphrase other researchers—add your own interpretations where possible, discussing the significance of findings in relation to the literature as a whole
	\item Critically evaluate: mention the strengths and weaknesses of your sources
	\item Write in well-structured paragraphs: use transition words and topic sentences to draw connections, comparisons and contrasts
\end{itemize}
